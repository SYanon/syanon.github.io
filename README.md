# My Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is where I showcase my professional journey, skills, and experiences. I built this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean, modern space that represents me.

## What's Inside

- **About Me**: A quick introduction with my photo and social links
- **Work Experience**: My professional journey, from my current role at Beko Global R&D to my past experiences
- **Education**: My academic background, including my studies at Koç University
- **Extracurricular**: My language skills, leadership roles, and other activities outside of work

## Features I Added

- A dark/light mode toggle that remembers your preference
- Smooth scrolling when you click on navigation links
- A responsive design that works well on phones and computers
- A timeline layout for my work experience and education
- Social media links to connect with me

## How I Built It

I started with a simple HTML structure and added CSS to make it look good. Then I added some JavaScript to make it interactive. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which makes it easy to update and maintain.

## File Structure

```
.
├── index.html          # The main webpage
├── styles.css          # All the styling
├── script.js           # Interactive features
└── assets/            # Images and other media
    └── img/           # My photos
```

## Future Plans

I'm always looking to improve my website. Some ideas I have:
- Adding a contact form
- Including more interactive elements
- Adding a blog section
- Improving the mobile experience

Feel free to explore the code and use it as inspiration for your own website!
